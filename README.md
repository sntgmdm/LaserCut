SW: PC Draftsight - To use without activation:
Shh do not tell them this works: To get rid of the activation message just open Regedit.exe and navigate to: “HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SWActivation\K2” Delete any sub key and value below “K2” (default key stays). Now edit permission on “K2”. Remove Full-Control from your Current-User and set to Read-Only instead. Replace permission on this object. You should be able now to start DraftSight without the activation message.
